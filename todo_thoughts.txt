List of stuff todo before launching anything at all...

- Generate images at any arbitrary size
- Need to give user a way to specify:
  - Instruction image size
  - Paths to required apps (LDraw, L3P, Pov-Ray)
  - Model to be opened and work with  (Open menu)
  - Save As menu

- Use new style classes that inherit from 'object'
- Change opengl import to from OpenGL import GL, then qualify all GL code with GL.
- Rename all opengl variables from ogl to just gl
- Surround 3rd party imports in try...catch blocks

Eventually:
- Implement at least one tree-based drag and drop feature
- Fix part cache to be one global cache file, based on rendered image size, not model
  - Add parts to that one global cache, so cache can be shared by all renderings of that size

Lic thoughts on default vs. local settings.

- Any changes on any particular page apply to that one selected item.

- Provide one 'default' instruction page, as a sample page, where the user can
set all the defaults for the overall document.


Lic thoughts on coordinate systems.

Provide two ways to specify overall doc size
- raw width / height in pixels, for web / raw images
- physical page size in mm + DPI resolution, for printing

0 LIC DOCSIZE IMAGE 800 600   # width height in pixels
  or 
0 LIC DOCSIZE PRINT 8.5 11 600  # width height DPI (in inches, mm whatever)

If DOCSIZE PRINT is specified, calculate and use an internal pixel width & height

All width / height / x / y measurements throughout the model file are then float values from 0..1,
and are fractions of the overall width / height specified by DOCSIZE

Only problem with this is if the *aspect ratio* changes, ie the ratio of DOCSIZE width / height.

If the aspect ratio changes (by the user, using a valid Lic operation), recalculate every single height 
and y value (or width and x) throughout the document.

Preserving the displayed aspect ratio is more important than respecting user's doc size change, because
otherwise they'll end up with skewed bricks and fonts and box borders and a mess.

So, for example, if the width remains constant but the DOCSIZE height doubles, need to cut all internal 
heights and y displacements in half.  This will add a bunch of empty white space at the bottom of the document.
Could possibly re-center CSIs and page numbers based on new height... but don't want to change any CSI's actual height.

To ensure the user doesn't change the aspect ratio outside Lic, maybe add another Lic command later on, like

0 LIC ASPECT RATIO 2:1 # or something
