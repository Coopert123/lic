Lic TODO:

BUGS:

- Need an Icon for Lic.exe, something more different than LDD logo

- Need to handle submodels that are not embedded in the main model file (additional part lookup paths)

- Fully implement Conditional Lines

- Fix missing Primitive Edges, like from inside a 2x4 brick
 
- Fix saw.dat so all edges & surfaces render properly

- Add full undo / redo support for all auto-layout actions

- In Merged Callouts, need to handle adding / removing parts 

- Add fourth draw layer, to handle Callouts as annotations above other GL items, then Callout GL items very very top

 FEATURES:

- Add support for reading colors from LDCONFIG.LDR

- Add a dialog on initial import: if the imported file has no steps, give a handful of options 
that control auto-page & step generation (one step / page, min / max parts per step, etc)
 
- Add 'Add Length Indicator' menu option to each PLIItem

- Add Snap to Center of page items, not just left / right edges

- Fix 'Snap to Items' so we only consider snapping to meaningful, similar items

- Add ability to merge multiple parts into one new part (like for technic bendy U-joints & turntables)

- Pages that span multiple Submodels (ie, last step of Submodel on same page as MainModel step that adds submodel)

- Page annotations that span Pages (like Submodel-goes-here arrow across facing pages)

- Add Auto-layout menu option to Part List Page.  Need to bump parts from page to page to handle this.

- When displacing a part, count the # of studs and add an appropriate number of appropriately positioned arrows

- When displacing a technic part, try to get the arrow coming out of the hole

- Think about 'selection group' class, especially SelectedPart class, to better handle context menus for multiply selected items

- Displacing a part inside a Callout does not auto-resize the overall callout, because Step stays big
 
- On Import, auto-shrink CSIs so they fit on a page
 
- Consider PyInstaller over py2exe, for its multi-platform goodness

- PDF export needs dialog to control export setting, mainly high-res scale multiplier setting (current hardcoded to 3)

- Add progress bar to File->Open operation

- Create a proper Properties dialog.  On it:
  - Expose most of lic.ini settings 
  - Add ability to save or auto-delete backup save files
  
- Clean up load / save: we're creating a lot of objects only to totally overwrite them later in load
  (like step.pli & csi)
