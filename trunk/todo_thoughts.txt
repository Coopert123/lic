Lic TODO:

BUGS:

- Need an Icon for Lic.exe, something more different than LDD logo

- Still need to handle submodels that are not embedded in the main model file

- Fully implement Conditional Lines

- Fix missing Primitive Edges, like from inside of 2x4 brick
 
- Fix saw.dat, so all edges & surfaces rendered properly

- Add full undo / redo support for all auto-layout actions

- In Merged Callouts, need to handle adding / removing parts 

 - Displacing a part inside a callout does not correctly resize the overall callout
 
 FEATURES:

- Add Snap to Center of page items, not just left / right edges

- Pages that span multiple Submodels (ie, last step of Submodel on same page as MainModel step that adds submodel)

- Add Part Count label to default title Page

- Add Auto-layout menu option to Title & Part List Page

- Add CSI->Remove Rotation for rotated CSIs.  Will remove rotation label too

- When displacing a part, count the # of studs and add an appropriate number of appropriately positioned arrows

- When displacing a technic part, try to get the arrow coming out of the hole

- Think about 'selection group' class, especially SelectedPart class, to better handle context menus for multiply selected items

- PDF export needs dialog to control export setting, mainly high-res scale multiplier setting (current hardcoded to 3)

- Add status bar on PDF export: in Instructions.exportToPDF(), exportImages() takes 7-10x longer than everything else 

- Add status indicator to file->open operation

- Finally cave in and create a proper Properties dialog.  On it:
  - All OpenGL rendering options, notably ambient light setting
  - Expose most of lic.ini settings 
  - Add ability to save or auto-delete backup save files
  
General Niceness:

- Surround optional 3rd party imports in try...catch blocks

- Clean up load / save: we're creating a lot of objects only to totally overwrite them later in load
  (like step.pli & csi)
