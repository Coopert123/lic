Lic TODO:

Thoughts on displacing parts:

- Need to give user a way to specify:
  - Paths to required apps (LDraw, L3P, Pov-Ray)

- Surround optional 3rd party imports in try...catch blocks

- Clean up load / save: we're creating a lot of objects only to totally overwrite them later in load
  (like step.pli & csi)
  
- Still need to handle submodels that are not embedded in the main model file.

- Add status indicator to file->open operation

- In step context, add 'append / prepend blank step'

  
For 2.0:

- Callouts within callouts

- Step borders / fills

- multiple steps per rect

- multiple GL arrows on part displacement
