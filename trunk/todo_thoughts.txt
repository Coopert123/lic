Lic TODO:

- Need to give user a way to specify:
  - All OpenGL rendering options, notably ambient light setting

- Need a logo

- Surround optional 3rd party imports in try...catch blocks

- Clean up load / save: we're creating a lot of objects only to totally overwrite them later in load
  (like step.pli & csi)
  
- Still need to handle submodels that are not embedded in the main model file.

- Add status indicator to file->open operation

- Add Snap to Center of page items, not just left / right edges

- Pages that span multiple Submodels (ie, last step of Submodel on same page as MainModel step that adds submodel)

- Fully implement Conditional Lines

- Fix missing Primitive Edges, like from inside of 2x4 brick
 
- Fix saw.dat, so all edges & surfaces rendered properly
 
- Automatically clone pages / steps from one submodel to another, if they're siimliar enough (mirrored)
