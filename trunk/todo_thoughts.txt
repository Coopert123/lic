Lic TODO:

Thoughts on displacing parts:

- Generate images at any arbitrary size
- Need to give user a way to specify:
  - Instruction image size
  - Paths to required apps (LDraw, L3P, Pov-Ray)

- Surround optional 3rd party imports in try...catch blocks

- Fix part cache to be one global cache file, based on default rendered image size, not model
  - Add parts to that one global cache, so cache can be shared by all renderings of that size
  - Not a priority, since calculating part sizes is usually only a few seconds, at most

- Only create config paths when a file is about to be exported.  No sense creating them on model import!

- Still need to handle submodels that are not embedded in the main model file.

- Have a small problem where if you click on a submodel, its node is expanded automatically 
  and its first page is selected, which is fine.  But if you then use arrow keys to move up or left, 
  selection is automatically forced back to the first page.  Kinda unnatural.  
  To fix, when a submodel is selected, do not automatically select the first page, select the submodel itself, and just draw its first page.

- Add status indicator to file->open operation


For 2.0:

- Title page

- Bill of Materials

- Callouts within callouts

- non-rectangluar callouts

- Step borders / fills

- multiple steps per rect

- multiple GL arrows on part displacement

- Look into GraphViz for some seriously heavy duty auto-layout options. GraphViz's plain-ext output
  mode could work wonders, especially when creating an entire book from scratch.

- Try snap-to other page items, like in Flex Builder
